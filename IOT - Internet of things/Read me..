IOT Skill lab session was held on 9th and 10th jan
1) First!, We managed to successfully create a model with a ultrasonic sensor and a buzzer, which will beep when the obstacle is near to it by 10m or less.
2) Simple led blinking in a sequence of delay 1second.
3) Using dt11 we managed to find out the temperature of the room and get the output on the serial monitor.
4) Displayed a simple hello world on the given oled screen.
5) Next we combined both the dt11 and oled to check the room temperature and display it on the oled screen.
6) Lastly we got a button through which we managed to work around with it to lit the led when the button is pressed.
